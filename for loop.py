# for loop is a another type of loop in python 
a = "nick is best coder \n" #same we did here also as we did in while loop we gave printing statment 
b=10 #initilaising the value of b
for i in range(b):#i is a vraible which holdes the value of range , range is function which use to help to run the loop by giving him the command that , that many time you have to repeate the printing statment , we can supply both a varible which have a value and direct integer value,it stop when the value side the range stisfied the loop
    print(i+1,a)#printing i to know how many times loops run and a to print the printing statment
