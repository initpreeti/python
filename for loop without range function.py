# suppose we have a list yes - yes i know that you dont know what is list so for to understand to this you have a list of fruits
a = ["banana","Apple","Mango","Govava"]
# print(a) yes for printing this statment will work but its print with square bracket too
#know the question comes how we remove the bracket for that we use for loop
for fruits in a:#here we didn't use the range function but still our for loop works
    print(fruits)#if we print like this then no bracket will print
