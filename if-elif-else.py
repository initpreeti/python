# now one more type of condition statement and that is if-elif-else
# if this is true then do this if that is true then do that if no one is true do this , this how we can understand the if-elif-else
a = 20#input a 
b = 21#input b
if a>b:#condition one
    print("a is grater than b")
elif a<b:#condition two
    #we can use as many elif we need there is no restriction 
    print("b is greater than a")
else:#if both are not true then do this
    print("both are equal")
