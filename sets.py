'''Sets don't guarantee the order of the items and are not indexed.
A key point when using sets: they don't allow repetition of an item.we declare 
set by the help of curly bracket'''
#assume we have a set of fruits
fruits = {"banana","orage","govava","apple","lichi"}
#for to access we just use the print statment
print(fruits,"\n")

#another method to access the set
for items in fruits:
    print(items)
